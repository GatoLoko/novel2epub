Did I reincarnate? Or was I transported to an Isekai cultivation world? To be
honest, I have no clue!</p>

<p>What matters is that I turned from being useless, bullied, and trash, to
fully-fledged garbage in my new cultivation world!</p>

<p>But what is this strange bleep that keeps ringing in my ears? Is this some
kind of system? Oh God! Did you gift me such a clich√©, right at the start of my
journey?</p>

<p>Wait, why are you trying to kill me? Did I do something to you? Stand back
or I will be forced to use unstoppable Exhudia!</p>

<p>Tell me, what did she do for you to treat your significant other in this
way?  Let me show you how girlfriends should be taken care of!</p>

<p>Wait, everyone was always telling me that demons are bad, so why is this
demonic queen trying to seduce me? Wait! KEEP YOUR HANDS AWAY FROM MY PRECIOUS
SWORD!</p>

<p>I just came back from a mission and was promised at least a half a year of
break. Why are you bothering me again with something as silly as subjugating a
devil general?
